Description for Assignment 4

****************************************************ANIMATION****************************************************

	The intended animation for this assignment was for Sonic to go in a circle and interact 
with the ring objects making them disappear. Unfortunately, using translate and rotate
do not update the x and y coordinates of the object being manipulated. This led to troubles
recognizing the proximity of Sonic to the rings.

	In the final animation, Sonic is a subclass of the Character class and spins in a circle around a loop.
The spikes surrounding Sonic spin around the object to give the appearance that Sonic
is going fast. Similarly, as Tails moves up and down the screen, WhiteTail objects spin around
him and follow his movement. The Shuriken class has shurikens bounce from the left to the right side of the
screen while spinning around. Four fireballs were created from the Fireball class to revolve around the shurikens.
The Ring class creates a Ring object that can disappear and reappear over a certain period of time. The Item class
was not used but remained there in case it was needed.
