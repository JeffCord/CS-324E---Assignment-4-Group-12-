# CS-324E---Assignment-4-Group-12-


To run the "a4_2D Animation" program, first click the play button at the top of the screen. This will automatically open up a window which will display all the objects that we made for this assignment, including the fireball, shrunken, rings, sonic and tails. All the objects are in 2 dimension and are continuously animated without further action of the users. 

For each objects, they are animating in their own ways. The sonic and tails are spinning and rotating, the fireball rotate around the shrunken and the shrunken is rotating by itself as well, both the fireball and the shrunken as a whole are moving from left to right and right to left, and the rings disappear immediately and fade back in.

We chose a background image that fit with the scene and as it has water, we implemented a rain effect on the background with a certain alpha value to make it looks more real. In addition, we imported a background music for this animation with an old fashioned classic game music. There is also a sound effect we added to the program that when user click the "space bar" the rings' sound effect will appear.
